      p2: 'In addition to the over 100 herbal ingredients documented, a key feature of the Herbapedia was its high-quality vector images, entirely drawn from scratch to illustrate to the reader how particular herbal medicine plants look like.',
      p3: 'The Herbapedia was developed and funded by Vita Green and hosted for public consumption since then. As a founding member of the SIPM, Vita Green has given permission to the SIPM to reproduce and expand the data set for open use, and the SIPM is grateful to continue the baton of the Herbapedia.'

      title: 'What are Medicinal Plants?',
      p1: 'Medicinal plants, also called medicinal herbs, have been discovered and used in traditional medicine practices since prehistoric times. Plants synthesize hundreds of chemical compounds for various functions, including defense against insects, fungi, diseases, and herbivorous mammals.',
      p2: 'Herbaceous plants are vascular plants that have no persistent woody stems above ground. They may be annuals, biennials, or perennials. Unlike woody plants (trees and shrubs), herbaceous plants have soft, green stems that die back to the ground at the end of the growing season.',
      p3: 'The study of medicinal plants is called medicinal botany or pharmacognosy. This field encompasses the identification, collection, preservation, and therapeutic application of plants used in medicine. Modern pharmacognosy integrates traditional knowledge with contemporary scientific methods.'
    },
    importance: {
      title: 'The Importance of Medicinal Plants',
      p1: 'All major food crops worldwide are herbaceous plants—their fruits, seeds, roots, and leaves form the foundation of human nutrition. Beyond nutrition, herbaceous plants produce much of the world\'s oxygen through photosynthesis and play a critical role in preventing soil erosion through their root systems.',
      p2: 'In modern medicine, approximately 25% of prescription drugs are derived from medicinal plants or contain plant-derived compounds. The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the world\'s population relies on traditional medicine, primarily plant-based remedies, for their primary healthcare needs.',
      p3: 'Medicinal plants provide three main types of benefits: health benefits to consumers, financial benefits to harvesters and distributors, and societal benefits including job opportunities and improved public health. The global market for medicinal and aromatic plants exceeds $68 billion annually.'

    history: {
      title: 'History of Herbal Medicine',
      p1: 'The earliest historical records of medicinal plants date to the Sumerian civilization (c. 3000 BC), where hundreds of plants including opium were documented on clay tablets. The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BC) describes over 850 plant medicines. The Greek physician Dioscorides documented over 1,000 recipes using 600 medicinal plants in "De materia medica" (c. 60 AD), which remained the authoritative reference for over 1,500 years.',
      p2: 'Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) documented plant medicines in the "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" and expanded during the Tang Dynasty. Ayurvedic medicine in India has used hundreds of herbs and spices for millennia, documented in texts such as the Atharva Veda and Sushruta Samhita. During the Islamic Golden Age, scholars translated and expanded upon Greek texts, developing sophisticated pharmacopoeias.',
      p3: 'The 19th century marked a turning point when chemical analysis enabled the isolation of active compounds. Alkaloids such as morphine (1806), quinine, and later cardiac glycosides were purified, establishing the foundation for modern pharmacology. Today, drug discovery continues to draw on ethnobotanical knowledge to identify new therapeutic compounds.'
