  Indigenous Americans used cranberries in poultices for treating wounds and blood poisoning. American sailors and colonists used cranberries to prevent scurvy, similar to the use of citrus by the British. They also used cranberries and their leaves for various conditions including blood disorders, stomach ailments, liver problems, fever, swollen glands, and mumps.
