description: |
  Bilberry has been used in European medicine for nearly a thousand years, primarily to treat gastric disorders and diarrhea. The fruit contains tannins, substances that act as both an anti-inflammatory and an astringent (constricting and tightening tissues), which is thought to be the reason for their ability to soothe stomach problems. The leaves of the bilberry plant were also traditionally used to treat diabetes.
