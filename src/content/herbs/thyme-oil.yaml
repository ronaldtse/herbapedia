  Thyme oil has a long history of use and was valued for its medicinal properties by the Greeks, Egyptians and Romans. Its name comes from the Greek word "thymos", meaning perfume, since thyme oil was used as incense in temples. It was also one of the substances used by Egyptians in the embalming process.
