  Danggui first appeared in Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica, classified as middle class.In the late 1800s, an extract of the herb sold as Eumenol became popular in Europe as a treatment for gynecological complaints. Recently, interest in danggui has resurged in the West due to its proposed weak oestrogen-like properties.
